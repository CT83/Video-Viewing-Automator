<b>Vision</b>:

<b>Result</b>:
<ul>
<li>It was a major success as it removed need of 3 Shifts of unskilled workers working 24x7.</li>
<li>Saved the company 33% in revenue</li>
<li>Increased efficiency by 50%</li>

<b>Conclusion</b>
After all the Stats Generation, and running successfully for a month the website went offline and turned out to be a scam and thus due to unavoidable circumstances the project failed to generate me any revenue, my efforts practically being futile; Though looking back, the experience I gained during the development of the application prepared me for my future projects.
